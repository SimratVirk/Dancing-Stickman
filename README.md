This code helps to create different animations using various interactive buttons.
The sliders control the appropriate limb of the puppet and the x-position slider the horizontal position of the puppet.
The save button, saves the current limb positions and horizontal position to an array.  It will also update the Frames saved message to reflect the number of frames saved.
The reset button, removes all the saves positions from the array. It will also reset the Frames saved message to 0.
The start button, starts the playback of the saved positions at 15 frames per second
The top button, stop the playback
